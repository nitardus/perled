PERLED
=====

This project tries to implement an clone of the UNIX standard text
editor in less than 150 lines of code, none of them exceeding 100
characters. It comes without any external dependencies (unless perl,
of course), can be copied as a file and run with only the interpreter
installed, or even typed in, if it must be. I'm planning to add
another version which is more human readable (but easily double in
size) in the near future.

There is also an version which adds support for GNU Readline using the
Term::ReadLine:GNU module, which enhances the usability of this program a lot.

Please note: This is an early alpha, so errors and glitches will happen!
